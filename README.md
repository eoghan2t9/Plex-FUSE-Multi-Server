Plex FUSE Engine üöÄ
A high-performance, multi-instance virtual filesystem for Plex Media Server, built with Python and FUSE. This project mounts one or more remote Plex libraries as local, read-only filesystems on a Linux server, optimized for high-core-count CPUs and fast network connections.
Designed as a robust, self-healing background service managed by systemd, it's the definitive tool for integrating Plex with applications that require direct filesystem access, such as IPTV servers, custom media managers, or analysis scripts.
‚ú® Key Features
 * Multi-Server Architecture: Run and manage multiple, independent Plex mounts from different servers on a single machine using systemd template services. Each instance is completely isolated.
 * Blazing-Fast Scanning: Utilizes a highly parallel, producer-consumer architecture to scan massive libraries as quickly as possible, fully leveraging multi-core CPUs.
 * Resilient by Design:
   * üõ°Ô∏è Self-Healing Connections: Automatically detects and re-establishes dropped connections to the Plex server during file playback.
   * ü¶æ Robust Fetching Engine: Uses a "wget-style" direct request model that is resilient to network timeouts and firewall issues.
   * ‚ö° Instant Recovery: On restart, instantly loads the last known good cache from a persistent backend (SQLite or Redis/DragonflyDB) to ensure the mount is always available.
 * Live Status Dashboard: Each instance can run an optional, lightweight web server to display its current status, uptime, and real-time performance metrics.
 * On-Demand Rescans: Trigger a fresh library scan for any running instance without restarting the service using the systemctl reload command.
üìã Prerequisites
 * A Linux server with systemd (Tested on Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS/Fedora).
 * Python 3.6+ and pip.
 * Root or sudo access for installation.
 * (Optional) Docker for running a Redis-compatible cache like DragonflyDB.
üóÇÔ∏è Project Files
Your GitHub repository should contain the following files:
 * install.sh: The main installer script.
 * plex_fuse.py: The core Python FUSE script.
 * cache_manager.py: Handles the persistent cache logic for SQLite and Redis.
 * plex_fuse.ini.template: A template for creating new instance configurations.
 * requirements.txt: A list of the required Python libraries.
 * README.md: This file.
üõ†Ô∏è Installation
The installer script handles all dependencies, creates the Python virtual environment, and sets up the systemd service template.
 * Clone the Repository:
   git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>

 * Make the Installer Executable:
   chmod +x install.sh

 * Run the Installer:
   sudo ./install.sh

   > Note: The installer will prompt you for the user you wish to run the service as. This user will need the appropriate permissions for the mount point directories.
   > 
‚öôÔ∏è Configuration: Adding Your First Server
The installer sets up the framework. You now need to create a configuration for each Plex server you want to mount.
 * Navigate to the installation directory (default is /opt/plexfuse):
   cd /opt/plexfuse

 * Create a config file for your first instance. We'll use server1 as an example.
   cp plex_fuse.ini.template plexfuse@server1.ini

 * Edit the new config file:
   nano plexfuse@server1.ini

   * Fill in the [plex] section with your server's baseurl, token, and desired mountpoint.
   * In the [dashboard] section, assign a unique port number for this instance (e.g., 9988 for server1, 9989 for server2, etc.).
 * Create the mount point directory and set permissions (replace pi:pi with the user and group you chose during installation):
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/plex/server1
sudo chown pi:pi /mnt/plex/server1

üöÄ Service Management
All commands use the systemd instance syntax: plexfuse@<instance_name>.
| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Enable on Boot | sudo systemctl enable plexfuse@server1 |
| Start Now | sudo systemctl start plexfuse@server1 |
| Check Status | sudo systemctl status plexfuse@server1 |
| View Live Logs | journalctl -u plexfuse@server1 -f |
| Trigger Rescan | sudo systemctl reload plexfuse@server1 |
| Stop | sudo systemctl stop plexfuse@server1 |
| Restart | sudo systemctl restart plexfuse@server1 |
üñ•Ô∏è Usage
 * Access Files: Your Plex library will be available at the mountpoint you specified (e.g., /mnt/plex/server1).
 * View the Dashboard: From the server's terminal, you can view the live status:
   # Use the port you configured for the instance
curl http://localhost:9988

> To add a second server (e.g., server2), simply repeat the configuration steps, ensuring it has a unique mountpoint and dashboard port.
